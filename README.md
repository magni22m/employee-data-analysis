Employee Data Analysis
================

An analytical script for employment data written in Python for Data Science class Spring 2017. Manages a list of employee records and produces information like the correlation between employees' years of service and their salary. I used this as an opportunity to experiment with some of the functional programming tools in python like lambdas and the reduce() function.
